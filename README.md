Best NationalBankTransfer based BTC prices in Iran

i've just coded this to go n check all the pages of all BTC sellers in Iran who accept NationalBankTransfers as a valid payment method in localbitcoin.com n another Iranian site. those sellers are all with a trust ratio of more than 95 % n more than at least 3 trades, except they won't be in the check list at all, in order to lower the risk of transactionsðŸŒˆðŸ’°

it's been written in python, run it n let the code do the rest 4 u
# Caution:
it's an old code that doesn't work anymore. pull requests are welcomed :*
